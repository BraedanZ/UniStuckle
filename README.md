# UniStuckle

After unzipping the submitted file, you may open it as a project with Unity.  

To play the game prototype, go to https://braedanz.itch.io/unistuckleprototype1 using Google Chrome.  The game can be played in browser, but only chrome has been tested.  

The prototype for this game is very simple, as will the final version of the game.  In the final version, the physicas will be nailed down to use an actual wheel joint instead of just pushing the player accross the ground.

Controls:
Control Player lean with the left and right arrow keys.
Control forward and backward movement with the up and down arrow keys.
The further the player leans in the direction that they want to go, the faster they will move in that direction.  

Goal:
Get to the top of the hill.
It is possible if you delicately hover the player's "head" just above the ground.  Can you find the cheaty way that works in the prototype?  Let's hope no :)

Note:
This is prototype one.  Prototype 2 is already in the works and already has a rotating wheel.  However, the wheel often breaks the physics of the game and I have not yet found a solution.  I am already submitting this a day late after trying to solve this issue, so I am just submitting this version of the game instead.  The importance of the wheel is that it makes the player roll all of the way down the hill if they stop moving forward instead of slowly sliding down the hill.
